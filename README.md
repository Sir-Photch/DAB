# DAB - *Discord Announcement Bot*
Bot that lets users `/set-chime` with a given audio-file, that plays each time they connect to a channel on your server.

## how to get started
Clone this repo and build it for your platform, or download the current release.
Consider [dependencies needed to run](./DEPENDENCIES.md).

On first startup, the bot will exit stating that a default-config has been created. You need to add your Discord-API-Key in `config.json`.
